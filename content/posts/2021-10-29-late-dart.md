Dart v2.9 added the **late** modifier on variables.

When Null Safety is enabled, it is sometimes necessary to explicitly state that we will initialize a non-null variable later.
Dart cannot always assume that a variable will be initialized later, as in the case of high-level variables. The following example would throw an error in Dart.

This can be used in the following two cases.

* Late assign: promise to assign later

* Late lazy: Initializing a variable will be later.

## Late assign

### Promise of late assignment for the migration of your project to Null Safey

Sometimes it is necessary to explicitly state that we will initialize a non-null variable later. Dart cannot always assume that a variable will be initialized later, as in the case of high-level variables.

The following example, if the variable is not initialized before using it would throw an error in the project with Null Safey in Dart:

```dart
class Team {
  String name;
}

void main(List<String> args) {
  Team team = Team();
  team.name = 'Flutter';
  print(team.name);
}
```

```shell
Uncaught Error: LateInitializationError: Field 'name' has not been initialized.
```

In this case, we are sure that we will initialize the variable, so we can tell Dart with the reservation keyword late.

```dart
late String name;
```

In this case, we are sure that we will initialize the variable, so we can tell Dart to do so with the reservation keyword **late**.

```dart
class Team {
  late String name;
}

void main(List<String> args) {
  Team team = Team();
  team.name = 'Flutter';
  print(team.name); // Output: Flutter
}
```

## Late lazy

This Lazy initialization is useful in the following cases:

* The variable may not be needed, and initializing it, is expensive.

* You are initializing an instance variable, and its initializer needs to access it.

### Initializing a variable without Lazy

```dart
int getNumMembers() {
  // Some calculation
  print('4. calculation number member...');
  return 10500;
}

class Team {
  int numMembers = getNumMembers();

  void initalizate() {
    print('2. initalization object Team...\n');
  }
}

void main(List<String> args) {
  print('1. Staring app main...\n');
  final team = Team()..initalizate();
  print('3. ---- processing main ... ----\n');

  print(team.numMembers);
}
```

Output:

```shell
1. Staring app main...

4. calculation number member...
2. initalization object Team...

3. ---- processing main ... ----

105000
```

### Initializing a variable with Lazy

```dart
int getNumMembers() {
  // Some calculation
  print('4. calculation number member...');
  return 105000;
}

class Team {
  late int numMembers = getNumMembers();

  void initalizate() {
    print('2. initalization object Team...\n');
  }
}

void main(List<String> args) {
  print('1. Staring app main...\n');
  final team = Team()..initalizate();
  print('3. ---- processing main ... ----\n');

  print(team.numMembers);
}
```

Output:

```shell
1. Staring app main...

2. initalization object Team...

3. ---- processing main ... ----

4. calculation number member...
105000
```

### Initializing a variable with Lazy Final

It is common to use **late** in combination with **final**, to defer the creation of <ins>read-only</ins> variables until the time they are first read.

```dart
int getNumMembers() {
  // Some calculation
  print('4. calculation number member...');
  return 105000;
}

class Team {
  late final int numMembers = getNumMembers();

  void initalizate() {
    print('2. initalization object Team...\n');
  }
}

void main(List<String> args) {
  print('1. Staring app main...\n');
  final team = Team()..initalizate();
  print('3. ---- processing main ... ----\n');

  print(team.numMembers);
}
```
